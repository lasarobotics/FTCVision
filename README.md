## Hi there!
This library is currently under insanely active development. We're in mid-Alpha phase right now. If you have any questions or would like to help,
send a note to `smo-key` (contact info on profile). Thank you!

## Goals

- Locate the lit target (the thing with two buttons) within the camera viewfield
- Move the robot to the lit target, while identifying the color status of the target
- Locate the button of the target color and activate it
